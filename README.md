# Game-Website-Template 

With this website, I hope to be able to host a variety of online, two-player, turn-based games (e.g. tic-tac-toe). Players will be able to create a login, and then either start a new game, or continue playing their current games against others online.

The first game created is called Battle Lines, and is a card game where players try to create the best hands to beat their opponent's hands.

This project uses python to handle the backend, Flask to create the structure of the website, and javascript to handle the front-end.
